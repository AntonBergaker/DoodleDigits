Doodle Digits is an inline calculator where you write equations into a large textbox and the answers are given to you as you type.  
This approach lets you easily go back and change things in your equation and is easy and intuative to use.

## Features
* Variables that can hold values
* Arbitrary precision numbers allow you to calculate very large numbers, some high limits are put in for performance reasons
* Autosaving that quickly lets you go back to where you were
* A large library of math functions
* Bitwise operations (keywords are `bxor`, `bor` and `band` to not clash with some other math notations)
* Hex and binary numbers (`0xE32C2C`, `0b10`)
* Vectors and matrices (`x = (1, 2)`, `det [[3, 4], [5, 6]]`) 

## Download and Install
Downloads and installation instructions can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/AntonBergaker/DoodleDigits/releases) page.

## Contributing
The project uses NET5.0 and C# 9 as I like having all the latest features.  
As in most projects, make sure whatever you submit is unit tested if necessary and that all tests pass.
